learning process of the python tkinterGUI and other topics needed to develop timers app

nov 17:    I'm done trying to learn pyqt, switching to tkinter, created repository

nov 18:    practiced using simplest widgets, fonts, colors, and canvas widget in particular; 
           learned how to place widgets onto the canvas, build .EXE with custom icon, 
           built my first graphic and first .exe app NERV.exe
        
nov 19:    learned how to make buttons with custom icons to keep GUI nice and simple, 
           and how to modificate icons in paint.NET, how to make tkinter canvas scrollable, 
           learned basics on parallel threads, learned about @decorators in python

nov 20:    learned about creating windows separate from main in tkinter, how to change 
           contents of the current window, how to remove borders of the buttons, how to
           create combobox and set a default value to it, done some designing work on 
           the timer system, also learned about extensions system in pycharm and tried
           deep code AI

nov 20-23: developed core features of the timers: timers can be added with a custom interval, 
           there are 5 signals to choose from, timer quantity is not limited,  the list 
           of timers can be seen as an abyssal scroll, each interval is displayed there,
           displaying remaining time as it ticks; visual style of the app went through
           redesign, now the app is very compact and light-looking. Most importantly,
           timers work, and their ticking and signal displaying are handled with separate
           threads so that time does not stop ticking while UI is used; i learned some
           other things, but i dont remember everything that happened in these 3 days;
           Designing a program that works not as a linear sequence of events, but as a 
           system which does its task responding to commands issued at any time, while 
           some of its processes run all the time in parallel was very different experience
           from everything i have developed up to this point; 
           Also since tkinter does not support background pictures and i want to force 
           my app to look nice, (anything consisting of comboboxes on white background
           is ugly, basically) i developed idea how to force tkinter to support background,
           the plan is crutchy, but hillarious
